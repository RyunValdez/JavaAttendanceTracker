# JavaAttendanceTracker
This is my portion of a class project that was designed to keep track of attendance records for students.
There were originally three clients that made up the entire project, the database, the admin, and the client. 
This is the client.

I have included a simple program given to me by my professor, Dr. Mehrgan Mostowfi, titled prototype server.
This program imitates the responses that the server client sends.
This allowed me to continue to work on this project alone and can be used to run the user client.
